If you require multiple objects of the same class, rather than downloading a
whole new container, you can:

	my $newobject = $tom->get_object();

Which provides will return an object identical to that which 
$tom->register() returns.

If you'd like an 'out-of-the-box' object, a constructer should live within
the contained class.

---

The class is registered into the correct namespace in the following order:

		BEGIN() - is executed
		main() - is executed
		* all other functions/methods are defined.
		import() - is executed
		object is recreated

This order is the same in Safe compartments also.

If you'd like more debug info, you can set the debug level to a number
higher than one (1), and Tom will generate some additional information for
you.  Not much, but a little.

I'm considering ways to get around the dynamic loading problem.  I'm
thinking quite strongly about the bytecode backend, and the byteload_string
method.  Perhaps classes could be forced into bytecode and stored in the Tom
container.  Of course, this would increase the size of the container, but
perhaps the benefits would outweigh the problems.
