TOM Kit, Version 2.0 (Final Release)
-----------------------------
TOM allows you contain objects within a TOM object.  This TOM object can
then be flattened into a general container which can be passed from machine
to machine.  The objects stored inside the container can be used on any
machine with both Perl and Tom installed.

A mailing list out there is appropriate for discussing Tom.  Subscribe to
perl5-agents-request@daft.com using the standard subscribe fred@foobar.com
syntax.  You can send mail to the list at perl5-agents@daft.com.
