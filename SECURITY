I do not claim that Tom has *any* security.

However, it does allow you use of a safe compartment,  which is
passed by reference to the Tom::register() method.  Tom will register the
class and *one* object (under the name of $obj) in that compartment.

Provided Opcode/Safe is secure, so is Tom.  Security isn't explicit, 
but it is present if wanted, and is awaiting an assignment.
